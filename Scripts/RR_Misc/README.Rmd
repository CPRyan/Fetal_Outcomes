How to do the fetal outcomes analysis. 


1. Run the initial analysis_script.R --- Do not run just the initial_analysis.Rmd at this point. I try will update if that changes.   
2. Run the primary and secondary analyses scripts. I modified the .Rmd, so I can run these. 
3. Change any of the parameters to _pregresid to make sure I have accounted for days pregnant in the analysis.
