Created March 1st, 2021.

Notes:
- My original epigenetic age dataset had "age" wrong in it. Age was for survey, not blood draw. It actually didn't really matter, as I didn't use AgeAccel, instead I included ic_age_blood05 or whatever it's called. This **was** correct. The new version (which I'm using) has the correct age in it. - There were several individuals with mismatched sex, and several women where Chris's parity differed from mine. Those are corrected here.

```{r}
eage <- read_csv(here::here("Data/Clock_Data/2005/QC_Norm_LisaMcEwan_meth_DatMini3.output.csv")) %>% 
  as.character(eage$uncchdid)
