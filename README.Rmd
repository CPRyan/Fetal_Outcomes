# Setup

This project will be focusing on epigenetic age among a subset of about 334 women during pregnancy (denoted by '_p'). Also included are another 36 samples immediately following pregnancy (denoted by a '_b'). 

The analysis will first focus on two already created datasets:

* 'full_nsf_w_covariates.csv': phenotypic dataset created using the 14_Checking and Merging.Rmd (in CPR_Misc folder, run in Cebu_reproductive_histories project) by Dr. Ryan, March 2, 2021.
* 'clock_long_w_baddetP_kept_in.output.csv: contains the epigenetic age output for the samples above. Created by Dr. Ryan after preprocessing using the epigenetic clock calculator [here](http://dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu/new), February 10, 2021.
